# Anki-Robot-Advanced-Gesture-Recognition-System<br>
Face-to-Robot Interaction with Anki Vector to Support Wellness and Mental Health<br>

Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Someone experiencing mental health problems could have their thinking, mood, and behavior affected. Some of the benefits of positive mental health include:<br>
● Coping with life’s stresses<br>
● Being productive and positively contributing to the community<br>
There are several ways to maintain positive mental health including:<br>
● Connecting with others<br>
● Staying positive<br>
● Getting physically active<br>
Robot interaction with Anki Vector refers to making facial expressions (happy, sad, Neutral, Angry, and Disgusted) to the robot.<br>

You can understand the project better by reading AnkiRobotGestureRecognitionFinalReport.pdf and referring to AnkiRobotGestureRecognitionPresentation.pdf.<br>

To give an overview of the project:<br>
● The anki-vector-robot is set up and connected to the phone initially then a PC and it is Linux-based(recommended for development). This repository does not include the necessary setup for that as there are other plenty of resources (https://github.com/anki/vector-python-sdk).<br>
